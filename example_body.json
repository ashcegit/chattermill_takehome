                            "bodyTextSummary": "The government’s top levelling-up adviser has warned ministers that failure to tackle the funding crisis for councils across England is threatening one of the Conservatives’ flagship 2019 election promises. Andy Haldane, the chair of the government’s levelling-up advisory council, said a “root and branch rethink” of local authority funding was urgently required to prevent a fresh round of ever-deeper cuts to local services. Blaming austerity as the “root cause” behind growing numbers of council bankruptcies, he told the Guardian: “The surprising thing about this is that any of us are surprised – given the extent of the paring back over the past 15 years in local government funding, on to which you layer a dose of cost increases and inflation across the piece.” The former Bank of England chief economist, who was hired by Boris Johnson to mastermind the government’s levelling-up plans, said the crisis in town hall funding was forcing councils to slash the types of activities that could help power-up economic growth. “What gets cut is often the investment needed to grow out of a hole. So the hole kind of gets ever deeper, as you haven’t got the resources to invest to grow the local economy tomorrow,” he said. “Is this affecting levelling up? Yes, without question.” Increasing numbers of councils in England are warning they in effect face bankruptcy. Despite ministers taking evasive action with an extra £600m to top up funding plans for next year, MPs and council leaders from across the political divide say local authorities are still £4bn short in an “out of control” financial crisis. It comes amid a sharp rise in costs and growing demand on services, made worse by austerity-driven cuts and local missteps. Among the biggest casualties so far are Birmingham and Nottingham, as well as Woking in Surrey and Thurrock in Essex. A recent Guardian investigation revealed most authorities are planning to increase council tax bills by £2bn from April, slash “non-core” services and jobs, and sell off land, buildings and other assets in an attempt to balance their budgets. Ministers have sought to blame councils for their own financial woes, highlighting poor local decision-making and debt-laden authorities where councillors ploughed money into failed commercial investments. However, Haldane said he did not accept the argument, saying swingeing cuts to government funding had left those authorities “forced of necessity to gamble for resurrection”. A key architect of the government’s 12 levelling-up “missions” launched two years ago, he said limited progress had been made on the agenda as it had slipped down the list of Rishi Sunak’s priorities. He praised action on devolution, including plans for new mayoral authorities in the north-east of England and Yorkshire, but said a scorecard on levelling-up progress would be mixed at best. “There are some things where it’s going better than people appreciate. The standout one on that would be devolution,” he said. “The downside of having slipped out of the political spotlight is there might be fewer monies available to help finance this, and that’s a risk many local authorities are facing right now.” The economist, who is the chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts thinktank, predicted the financial pressure councils were under would likely result in deep cuts to arts, culture and recreation funding in particular. However, he said these types of activities were key to boosting towns and cities outside London and the south-east of England, arguing that green spaces, libraries, galleries, high streets and football clubs were among the local assets that would attract people to live and work in an area. “They are somehow seen as being the hundreds and thousands, or the icing on the cake. But we know they absolutely are the cake. We know in the most deprived parts of the UK, what matters most are those things,” he said. “But we’re still underinvesting in them. We invest diddly squat in what might be called social infrastructure relative to what we invest in physical or digital infrastructure, and it’s always the first casualty of cuts by local government.” A government spokesperson said it was “dedicated to levelling up” and had committed £13bn to support projects. It also said it recognised councils were facing challenges and had provided £600m more for English local authorities for the upcoming financial year. “This additional funding has been welcomed by leading local government organisations – but we remain ready to talk to any concerned council about its financial position,” the spokesperson said.",

My last word on the issue before a day of lament …. To be fair India bowled very tidily. But with their main spinner out, and seemingly Bumrah not available to bowl this afternoon, that could be a defining innings for English cricket. Not only does it likely end this match and with it the chance of a series win, but it also echoes all the doubts and international criticism of England’s approach. That Root’s crazy dismissal was the obvious turning point is unavoidable and might make it the single most negligent act on the cricket field in living memory.”</em></p>"

                            "bodyTextSummary": "Speaking at the Munich Security Conference this morning, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, opted to focus on the importance of supporting Ukraine and called for strengthening the European pillar of Nato. “We therefore all have to ask ourselves, two years after the start of the war, are we actually doing enough to signal to Putin we are in for the long haul?” he said. The chancellor added: Are we doing enough, given that we know full well what Russia’s victory in Ukraine would mean, namely the end of Ukraine as a free, independent, democratic state, the destruction of our peaceful order in Europe, the gravest test of the UN charter since 1945, and not least, an encouragement to any and all autocrats around the world to use force to resolve conflicts. The political and financial prices we would then have to pay be many times higher than all the expense of our support to Ukraine today and in the future. The chancellor also said: The threat from Russia is real. That is why our deterrence and defence capabilities have to be credible and remain credible. At the same time, we don’t want a conflict between Russia and Nato, and for that reason all countries supporting Ukraine have been in agreement ever since the start of the war that we will not send our own troops to Ukraine. However, Putin and the military establishment in Moscow must be left in no doubt that we, the world’s strongest military alliance, are able to defend every square meter of our allied territory. And for that, it’s important that we further strengthen the European pillar in Nato, also in the sphere of deterrence. Germany will invest 2% of GDP in defence, he stressed. “Regardless of how Russia’s war in Ukraine ends, and regardless also of the outcome of elections on either side of the Atlantic, one thing is crystal clear: we Europeans need to do much more for our security now and in the future,” the chancellor said, adding that “our readiness to do so is considerable” and that he said this to the American president, Joe Biden. He also thanked North American allies for being strong allies and friends. Without naming Donald Trump, the German leader said: Any relativisation of Nato’s mutual defence guarantee will only benefit those who, just like Putin, want to weaken us.",

Rationally, I understood that it would be tough for him to be freed [from prison]. But, emotionally, I never doubted that he would be free. </p> <p>We’re all chatting together to support each other.He was our hero who united the opposition. Navalny gave us a Russian dream, that maybe in a decade we’d live in a free Russia. </p> <p>There is still opposition. Although it’s very difficult, there are still people who support Ukraine and want peace negotiations. We love our country and want the best for it. </p> <p><strong>Nikolai*, 22, student in Moscow</strong></p> <h2>‘Navalny chose to become a symbolic figure of resistance’</h2> <p>I’ve never been a supporter of Navalny as a politician – he is too on the right of the political spectrum and I’m on the left.

                            "bodyTextSummary": "Western leaders have held Vladimir Putin responsible for Alexei Navalny’s death in prison, where he had been sentenced to 19 years under a “special regime”. Navalny’s death – a pivotal moment for the country’s fractured pro-democracy movement – sent waves of anger and despair through the ranks of his supporters both in Russia and abroad. Six Russians share their reaction and what they believe his death will mean for Russia’s future. ‘My friends and I are devastated’ My friends and I are devastated: we lost someone who played a crucial part in our lives. Navalny’s positive energy always gave me hope that everything would be OK. Rationally, I understood that it would be tough for him to be freed [from prison]. But, emotionally, I never doubted that he would be free. We’re all chatting together to support each other.He was our hero who united the opposition. Navalny gave us a Russian dream, that maybe in a decade we’d live in a free Russia. There is still opposition. Although it’s very difficult, there are still people who support Ukraine and want peace negotiations. We love our country and want the best for it. Nikolai*, 22, student in Moscow ‘Navalny chose to become a symbolic figure of resistance’ I’ve never been a supporter of Navalny as a politician – he is too on the right of the political spectrum and I’m on the left. However, I respect him as a man of courage. Having survived an assassination attempt, he could have stayed safe in the EU, but he returned to Russia. Certainly, he knew what he was heading into.

Two ringside judges scored it for Foster by scores of 115-112 and 116-111, while a third had it 114-113 to Nova. (The Guardian scored it 115-112 for Foster.)</p> <p>Before a crowd of several thousand at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, Foster overcame a game challenger fighting on home ground and what appeared to be a right bicep injury in the fifth round to grind out the result in his second title defense. His first, four months ago in Cancun, also required a finishing kick with the outcome in doubt going into the final session.</p> <p>“I don’t want to make any excuses, but when I went to throw a right hand [in the fifth], his elbow hit the middle of my bicep, so it kind of tightened my stuff up,” Foster said afterward. “My rhythm was off tonight, but it’s all good. We came home with the win, so I can’t complain.”</p> <p>The switch-hitting Foster (22-2, 10 KOs) came out in an orthodox stance at the opening bell and struggled to find his footing in the first couple of rounds. The sturdy Nova doubled and tripled up his jab to keep the champion at bay, stepping into the pocket to throw harder shots when the opportunities surfaced.</p> <p>Nova (23-2, 16 KOs), a Puerto Rico native living in upstate New York who went off as a 7-1 underdog, was off to an inspired start, even as Foster immediately looked more comfortable when he switched to southpaw to open the third. But just when it looked like he was wresting control of the action, Nova landed a series of looping shots midway through the fourth that sent Foster across the ring and brought the crowd to its feet.</p> <p>At the same time Nova began showing signs of fatigue in the fifth, the champion began to step up his workrate and take command. That’s when Foster came away from an exchange in the center of the wincing and shaking his right hand in pain.</p> <p>After flagging badly in the sixth, Nova found a reserve at the start of the seventh, battering Foster with a flurry of punches along the ropes. Foster was the fitter man and landing the more accurate shots. But Nova, despite a split bottom lip that left a crimson stain across his blonde beard, stayed afloat with sheer hustle, volume and punch resistance.</p> <p>Even with the compromised right hand, the fresher Foster was able to stack rounds during the second half of the fight by landing the cleaner, harder shots. He spent the 10th picking apart his stubborn foe with crisp blows to the head and body. The 11th ended with both men trading hellfire along the ropes. Then came the 12th, where Nova’s granite chin absorbed one concussive shot after another until Foster finally dropped him with a short left hook in the final seconds that removed all doubt.</p> <p>“I’m a 12-round fighter and I know how to make judgements through the right,” said Foster, who landed 139 of 429 shots (32.4%) compared to 122 of 701 for Nova (17.4%), according to Compubox’s punch statistics. “He came on strong in the beginning, but I found my rhythm and his timing, and then I started picking it off.”</p> <p>Nova insisted the knockdown was a slip and should not have cost him an additional point on the final scorecards, but accepted the outcome. “O’Shaquie is a great fighter,” he said. “He did hit me, but I did slip. I lost my balance. I wasn’t hurt.”</p> <p>Foster, who grew up in the small east Texas town of Orange and lives in Houston, captured the vacant WBC title at 130lbs a little over a year ago, when he boxed his way to a clean 12-round unanimous decision over Rey Vargas, the previously unbeaten two-division champion bidding for a title in a third weight class. But it wasn’t until his first defense in October that he put his stamp on the division, coming from behind on two scorecards <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH0C5zfnh-s\">to stop Eduardo Hernández</a> in the 12th round following an action-packed 11th that was named <a href=\"https://www.ringtv.com/article/2023-round-of-the-year/\">Ring Magazine’s round of the year</a>.</p> <p>Since then Foster jumped promoters from Matchroom to Top Rank, signing a deal that will reportedly put him on ESPN three times a year. After his debut with the company on Friday night, there is no shortage of opportunities at 130lbs. Mexico’s Emanuel Navarrete, who holds the WBO’s version of the junior-lightweight title, is generally considered the class of the division. Other potential unification fights include Lamont Roach Jr, who holds the WBA title, or Joe Cordina, who owns the IBF strap.</p> <p>“I’ll be eventually going to 135, but I’m going to try to get a couple more fights at 130,” Foster said. “I’ll take the winner of Óscar Valdez and Liam Wilson [on 29 March], or if we can get Lamont Roach. I know Navarrete is going up to 135 to fight somebody, but if he comes back I’m willing for that, too.”</p>",

                                        "html": "<p>O’Shaquie Foster sure isn’t afraid of leaving things late.</p> \n<p>The 30-year-old Texan retained his WBC junior-lightweight title on Friday night with a split-decision win over Abraham Nova, taking control in the later stages and punctuating the closer-than-expected affair with a knockdown in the last 20 seconds of the final round. Two ringside judges scored it for Foster by scores of 115-112 and 116-111, while a third had it 114-113 to Nova. (The Guardian scored it 115-112 for Foster.)</p> \n<p>Before a crowd of several thousand at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, Foster overcame a game challenger fighting on home ground and what appeared to be a right bicep injury in the fifth round to grind out the result in his second title defense. His first, four months ago in Cancun, also required a finishing kick with the outcome in doubt going into the final session.</p> \n<p>“I don’t want to make any excuses, but when I went to throw a right hand [in the fifth], his elbow hit the middle of my bicep, so it kind of tightened my stuff up,” Foster said afterward. “My rhythm was off tonight, but it’s all good. We came home with the win, so I can’t complain.”</p> \n<p>The switch-hitting Foster (22-2, 10 KOs) came out in an orthodox stance at the opening bell and struggled to find his footing in the first couple of rounds. The sturdy Nova doubled and tripled up his jab to keep the champion at bay, stepping into the pocket to throw harder shots when the opportunities surfaced.</p> \n<p>Nova (23-2, 16 KOs), a Puerto Rico native living in upstate New York who went off as a 7-1 underdog, was off to an inspired start, even as Foster immediately looked more comfortable when he switched to southpaw to open the third. But just when it looked like he was wresting control of the action, Nova landed a series of looping shots midway through the fourth that sent Foster across the ring and brought the crowd to its feet.</p> \n<p>At the same time Nova began showing signs of fatigue in the fifth, the champion began to step up his workrate and take command. That’s when Foster came away from an exchange in the center of the wincing and shaking his right hand in pain.</p> \n<p>After flagging badly in the sixth, Nova found a reserve at the start of the seventh, battering Foster with a flurry of punches along the ropes. Foster was the fitter man and landing the more accurate shots. But Nova, despite a split bottom lip that left a crimson stain across his blonde beard, stayed afloat with sheer hustle, volume and punch resistance.</p> \n<p>Even with the compromised right hand, the fresher Foster was able to stack rounds during the second half of the fight by landing the cleaner, harder shots. He spent the 10th picking apart his stubborn foe with crisp blows to the head and body. The 11th ended with both men trading hellfire along the ropes. Then came the 12th, where Nova’s granite chin absorbed one concussive shot after another until Foster finally dropped him with a short left hook in the final seconds that removed all doubt.</p> \n<p>“I’m a 12-round fighter and I know how to make judgements through the right,” said Foster, who landed 139 of 429 shots (32.4%) compared to 122 of 701 for Nova (17.4%), according to Compubox’s punch statistics. “He came on strong in the beginning, but I found my rhythm and his timing, and then I started picking it off.”</p> \n<p>Nova insisted the knockdown was a slip and should not have cost him an additional point on the final scorecards, but accepted the outcome. “O’Shaquie is a great fighter,” he said. “He did hit me, but I did slip. I lost my balance. I wasn’t hurt.”</p> \n<p>Foster, who grew up in the small east Texas town of Orange and lives in Houston, captured the vacant WBC title at 130lbs a little over a year ago, when he boxed his way to a clean 12-round unanimous decision over Rey Vargas, the previously unbeaten two-division champion bidding for a title in a third weight class. But it wasn’t until his first defense in October that he put his stamp on the division, coming from behind on two scorecards <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH0C5zfnh-s\">to stop Eduardo Hernández</a> in the 12th round following an action-packed 11th that was named <a href=\"https://www.ringtv.com/article/2023-round-of-the-year/\">Ring Magazine’s round of the year</a>.</p> \n<p>Since then Foster jumped promoters from Matchroom to Top Rank, signing a deal that will reportedly put him on ESPN three times a year. After his debut with the company on Friday night, there is no shortage of opportunities at 130lbs. Mexico’s Emanuel Navarrete, who holds the WBO’s version of the junior-lightweight title, is generally considered the class of the division. Other potential unification fights include Lamont Roach Jr, who holds the WBA title, or Joe Cordina, who owns the IBF strap.</p> \n<p>“I’ll be eventually going to 135, but I’m going to try to get a couple more fights at 130,” Foster said. “I’ll take the winner of Óscar Valdez and Liam Wilson [on 29 March], or if we can get Lamont Roach. I know Navarrete is going up to 135 to fight somebody, but if he comes back I’m willing for that, too.”</p>"

Mourners and protesters also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2024/feb/16/mourners-gathers-across-europe-and-the-us-marking-the-death-of-navalny-video\">gathered across several cities in Europe and the US</a>.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Russia’s foreign ministry</strong> said the US should show restraint before accusing the country of causing Navalny’s death.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russians who voted for Putin</strong> <strong>at elections next month</strong> <strong>should realise they were voting for a murderer. </strong>“The events tell (us) that Putin is a murderer and this is not rhetoric,” Zelenskiy told a news conference in Paris,</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy signed a security pact with France on Friday, hours after securing a similar deal with Germany</strong> <strong>hailed by its chancellor, Olaf Scholz, as a “historic step” to lock in support for Kyiv in its battle against Russia</strong>. Both agreements were part of Zelenskiy’s drive to shore up help for his forces in Avdiivka. The 10-year agreement with France included a French pledge for up to €3bn (£2.6bn/$3.2bn) in aid for 2024, officials said. On Saturday, Zelenskiy will address the Munich Security Conference, taking place against a backdrop of conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East and debate over the future of Nato.</p></li> \n</ul>"

The incursion at the hospital raised alarm about patients, medical workers and displaced Palestinians sheltering there. “There are still critically injured and sick patients that are inside the hospital,” said Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization (WHO), which said its staff were trying to reach the hospital after the Israeli raid. “There is an urgent need to deliver fuel to ensure the continuation of the provision of life-saving services.” Israel said its soldiers found ammunition and weapons in the hospital, as well as medication bearing names of some hostages.",

Israeli troops remained in Nasser hospital in Khan Younis after raiding it early Thursday, with Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry saying five intensive-care patients died on Friday due to power outages and a lack of oxygen supply caused by the attack.

Almost all the key figures, save the Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, were present in Munich on Friday, including foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan. Negotiations over a ceasefire in Gaza appear to have stalled, with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, pushing back hard on Friday against the US vision for after the war, particularly its calls for the creation of a Palestinian state. After speaking overnight with President Joe Biden, Netanyahu wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that Israel would not accept “international dictates regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians”, saying that if other countries unilaterally recognised a Palestinian state, it would give a “reward to terrorism”. In their call, Biden again cautioned Netanyahu against moving forward with a military operation in Rafah before coming up with a “credible and executable plan” to ensure the safety of Palestinian civilians, the White House said. Two people were killed and four wounded in what Israeli police said was a shooting attack near a junction in southern Israel on Friday.

But where do you start? What differentiates the bad rosters from the good ones or the bumbling organizations from the savvy ones in MLS? </p> <p>As teams from around the league rush to add the final few pieces to their respective puzzles before the 2024 regular season kicks off next week, now is a good time to take a step back and examine how the best squads are formed.</p> <p>Sure, with the league’s overly complex roster regulations, even some active MLS front office members don’t have a full grasp of all of the ins-and-outs and best practices when it comes to squad-building. But a look around the league can still help us identify a handful of the ‘golden rules’ of MLS roster construction.</p> <h2>Rule No 1: Use your DP spots wisely</h2> <p>In MLS, how you use your Designated Players spots has the potential to make or break your season. To lay the foundation, every team can sign up to three DPs. These are big-money players, either due to their transfer fees, their salaries, or some combination of the two, that can extend beyond the league’s basic salary cap structure. They’re the stars.</p> <p>How do you make the most of your DP spots? </p> <p>Well, using them all is a good place to start. <em>Yes, CF Montreal, everyone is staring at you while your lone DP Victor Wanyama sniffles in the corner by himself.</em> Signing three DPs gives you the best chance to have the most top-end talent on the field at any given time. You don’t absolutely have to have three DPs to be among the best in MLS – LAFC made it to the Concacaf Champions League (now Cup) final last year, finished third in the West, and made a run all the way to MLS Cup with just two DPs in their squad. </p> <p>But after coming up short in both of those finals, you can bet manager Steve Cherundolo would’ve liked one more piece to put his team over the top.</p> <p>Simply convincing three DPs to sign on the dotted line isn’t a ticket to trophies, though. For most teams, there’s not much sense in tying up one of those roster spots with a player in a lower-cost position. Defenders are important, there’s no denying that. But the best center backs, fullbacks, and goalkeepers don’t tend to fetch the same salaries or transfer fees as their more advanced teammates. In the back, you’re more likely to find bang for your buck, which is crucial in a salary-capped league.</p> <p>So to build a strong MLS roster, use all three DP spots and skew them towards the opposing goal rather than your own. Shooting for players in their prime – like Atlanta United president and CEO Garth Lagerwey <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/3924364/2022/11/22/atlanta-united-garth-lagerwey-sounders/\">preaches</a> – doesn’t hurt, either. A youngster with a high ceiling is fun right up until it becomes clear just how low his floor is.</p> <h2>Rule No 2: Find a ball-dominant playmaker</h2> <p>There’s no faster way to get into the playoff field in MLS than by building your team around a ball-dominant playmaker.</p> <p>Even as No.10s have moved into the half-spaces or deeper into midfield in most of Europe’s top leagues, they still thrive in MLS. Because there’s not enough money in the cap to spread tons of it evenly around the field, there tends to be a noticeable gap in quality between one team’s best DP attacker and the other’s worst defender. Having a skilled playmaker who loves to get on the ball helps maximize that gap, punishing weaker opponents with 70 incisive touches every game.</p> <p>In MLS, classic No 10s still get away with doing all the things that come with being a classic No 10 – they don’t have to give a ton of defensive effort and they’re allowed to roam to find the game in possession. Plus, they get <em>paid.</em> Thanks to the DP rule, MLS teams can pay their playmakers more than they’d make on comparable European teams.</p> <p>In another reality, New England Revolution star Carles Gil might’ve stayed in England or Spain and evolved into an inverted winger. In this one, though, he’s a perennial MLS MVP candidate as an attacking midfielder and making more money than he would on the other side of the Atlantic. </p> <p>Your ball-dominant playmaker doesn’t absolutely have to be a pure No 10. LAFC rose to the top of the league with Carlos Vela filling that role on the right side of a 4-3-3. Last summer, the Columbus Crew transitioned from an attacking midfielder in Lucas Zelarayán pulling their strings to a versatile forward in Cucho Hernández and proceeded to lift MLS Cup.</p> <p>Regardless of the specifics, finding a creative hub in the attack can take you from pretender to contender.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5a6bafb0e3983d2bc5e03fde4df2702e7d975ece\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a6bafb0e3983d2bc5e03fde4df2702e7d975ece/0_0_5040_3360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Last year, St Louis City’s Roman Bürki was the best shot stopper in MLS based on goals saved above expected.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Last year, St Louis City’s Roman Bürki was the best shot stopper in MLS based on goals saved above expected.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Barrett/ISI Photos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Rule No 3: Pay special attention to the spine</h2> <p>Remember the quality gap we talked about between the top DP attacker on one team and the weak defensive link on the other? That gap is real – but most of the true contenders in MLS try to close it by investing in their spine.</p> <p>One or two strong center backs and No 6 can cover for a multitude of defensive errors.</p> <p>The Seattle Sounders have been among the best in MLS for more than a decade by following this rule. In 2024, Yeimar Gómez Andrade, Jackson Reagan and João Paulo will form the base of one of the strongest spines in the league. Over in the East, Jakob Glesnes and Jack Elliott win everything in the back for the Philadelphia Union while José Martínez covers every blade of grass from his defensive midfield spot. With that trio starting regularly, the Union have finished on top of their conference in two of the last four years.</p> <p>Moving back a line, a top goalkeeper can have an outsized positive impact on your season. The New England Revolution won the Supporters’ Shield in 2021, in large part due to the performance of Matt Turner in goal. The US men’s national team starter saved nearly six goals more than expected that season, according to FBref, before his big Premier League move to Arsenal in the summer of 2022. Last year, Roman Bürki was the best shot stopper in MLS based on goals saved above expected. The former Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper was the single biggest on-field factor behind St Louis City’s push to the top of the Western Conference.</p> <p>In recent seasons, we’ve also seen teams pay extra attention to the spine by virtue of playing even less attention to the wings.</p> <p>FC Cincinnati abandoned the idea of playing with wingers when Pat Noonan arrived as their new manager, shifting underperforming wide attacker Álvaro Barreal to a left wingback role in 2022. A cast of impressive goal scorers, No 10 Lucho Acosta, midfield ball-winner Obinna Nwobodo, and center back Matt Miazga all deserve credit for helping Cincy go from worst-to-first. But Noonan’s decision to turn a mediocre winger into an elite left wingback who now has a set of European suitors was a key part of their turnaround, too. </p> <p>Tweaking Barreal’s role move repurposed an asset, freeing up more money for the spine.</p> <h2>Rule No 4: Look outside roster itself</h2> <p>The last ‘golden rule’ of MLS roster construction has very little to do with the roster itself.</p> <p>In a league with detailed rules that govern a big chunk of the money you can spend on your roster, it’s crucial to look outside the roster to find competitive advantages. The Columbus Crew did just that ahead of last season, paying CF Montreal a transfer fee to get Wilfried Nancy out of his contract in Canada and down to Ohio. Fast forward a year and Columbus have another MLS Cup and Nancy’s players are<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Chris_Ramirez17/status/1751973349008281851\"> tattooing</a> his quotes on their bodies. </p> <p>It’s safe to call that bit of creative thinking a success from Crew president Tim Bezbatchenko.</p> <p>Spending money on a coach can help create an edge. The same goes for a premier front office executive – again, FC Cincinnati is a great example. After adding Noonan and Chris Albright as head coach and general manager, respectively, from the Philadelphia Union, they’ve skyrocketed up the Eastern Conference standings over the last two seasons.</p> <p>Building a shiny new training facility like the Sounders <a href=\"https://www.soundersfc.com/video/sounders-fc-unveils-new-state-of-the-art-training-center\">just did</a> is a great way to sell prospective signings on your club.

                                        "html": "<p>It’s a noble goal. But where do you start? What differentiates the bad rosters from the good ones or the bumbling organizations from the savvy ones in MLS? </p> \n<p>As teams from around the league rush to add the final few pieces to their respective puzzles before the 2024 regular season kicks off next week, now is a good time to take a step back and examine how the best squads are formed.</p> \n<p>Sure, with the league’s overly complex roster regulations, even some active MLS front office members don’t have a full grasp of all of the ins-and-outs and best practices when it comes to squad-building. But a look around the league can still help us identify a handful of the ‘golden rules’ of MLS roster construction.</p> \n<h2>Rule No 1: Use your DP spots wisely</h2> \n<p>In MLS, how you use your Designated Players spots has the potential to make or break your season. To lay the foundation, every team can sign up to three DPs. These are big-money players, either due to their transfer fees, their salaries, or some combination of the two, that can extend beyond the league’s basic salary cap structure. They’re the stars.</p> \n<p>How do you make the most of your DP spots? </p> \n<p>Well, using them all is a good place to start. <em>Yes, CF Montreal, everyone is staring at you while your lone DP Victor Wanyama sniffles in the corner by himself.</em> Signing three DPs gives you the best chance to have the most top-end talent on the field at any given time. You don’t absolutely have to have three DPs to be among the best in MLS – LAFC made it to the Concacaf Champions League (now Cup) final last year, finished third in the West, and made a run all the way to MLS Cup with just two DPs in their squad. </p> \n<p>But after coming up short in both of those finals, you can bet manager Steve Cherundolo would’ve liked one more piece to put his team over the top.</p> \n<p>Simply convincing three DPs to sign on the dotted line isn’t a ticket to trophies, though. For most teams, there’s not much sense in tying up one of those roster spots with a player in a lower-cost position. Defenders are important, there’s no denying that. But the best center backs, fullbacks, and goalkeepers don’t tend to fetch the same salaries or transfer fees as their more advanced teammates. In the back, you’re more likely to find bang for your buck, which is crucial in a salary-capped league.</p> \n<p>So to build a strong MLS roster, use all three DP spots and skew them towards the opposing goal rather than your own. Shooting for players in their prime – like Atlanta United president and CEO Garth Lagerwey <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/3924364/2022/11/22/atlanta-united-garth-lagerwey-sounders/\">preaches</a> – doesn’t hurt, either. A youngster with a high ceiling is fun right up until it becomes clear just how low his floor is.</p> \n<h2>Rule No 2: Find a ball-dominant playmaker</h2> \n<p>There’s no faster way to get into the playoff field in MLS than by building your team around a ball-dominant playmaker.</p> \n<p>Even as No.10s have moved into the half-spaces or deeper into midfield in most of Europe’s top leagues, they still thrive in MLS. Because there’s not enough money in the cap to spread tons of it evenly around the field, there tends to be a noticeable gap in quality between one team’s best DP attacker and the other’s worst defender. Having a skilled playmaker who loves to get on the ball helps maximize that gap, punishing weaker opponents with 70 incisive touches every game.</p> \n<p>In MLS, classic No 10s still get away with doing all the things that come with being a classic No 10 – they don’t have to give a ton of defensive effort and they’re allowed to roam to find the game in possession. Plus, they get <em>paid.</em> Thanks to the DP rule, MLS teams can pay their playmakers more than they’d make on comparable European teams.</p> \n<p>In another reality, New England Revolution star Carles Gil might’ve stayed in England or Spain and evolved into an inverted winger. In this one, though, he’s a perennial MLS MVP candidate as an attacking midfielder and making more money than he would on the other side of the Atlantic. </p> \n<p>Your ball-dominant playmaker doesn’t absolutely have to be a pure No 10. LAFC rose to the top of the league with Carlos Vela filling that role on the right side of a 4-3-3. Last summer, the Columbus Crew transitioned from an attacking midfielder in Lucas Zelarayán pulling their strings to a versatile forward in Cucho Hernández and proceeded to lift MLS Cup.</p> \n<p>Regardless of the specifics, finding a creative hub in the attack can take you from pretender to contender.</p>"

                                        "html": "<h2>Rule No 3: Pay special attention to the spine</h2> \n<p>Remember the quality gap we talked about between the top DP attacker on one team and the weak defensive link on the other? That gap is real – but most of the true contenders in MLS try to close it by investing in their spine.</p> \n<p>One or two strong center backs and No 6 can cover for a multitude of defensive errors.</p> \n<p>The Seattle Sounders have been among the best in MLS for more than a decade by following this rule. In 2024, Yeimar Gómez Andrade, Jackson Reagan and João Paulo will form the base of one of the strongest spines in the league. Over in the East, Jakob Glesnes and Jack Elliott win everything in the back for the Philadelphia Union while José Martínez covers every blade of grass from his defensive midfield spot. With that trio starting regularly, the Union have finished on top of their conference in two of the last four years.</p> \n<p>Moving back a line, a top goalkeeper can have an outsized positive impact on your season. The New England Revolution won the Supporters’ Shield in 2021, in large part due to the performance of Matt Turner in goal. The US men’s national team starter saved nearly six goals more than expected that season, according to FBref, before his big Premier League move to Arsenal in the summer of 2022. Last year, Roman Bürki was the best shot stopper in MLS based on goals saved above expected. The former Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper was the single biggest on-field factor behind St Louis City’s push to the top of the Western Conference.</p> \n<p>In recent seasons, we’ve also seen teams pay extra attention to the spine by virtue of playing even less attention to the wings.</p> \n<p>FC Cincinnati abandoned the idea of playing with wingers when Pat Noonan arrived as their new manager, shifting underperforming wide attacker Álvaro Barreal to a left wingback role in 2022. A cast of impressive goal scorers, No 10 Lucho Acosta, midfield ball-winner Obinna Nwobodo, and center back Matt Miazga all deserve credit for helping Cincy go from worst-to-first. But Noonan’s decision to turn a mediocre winger into an elite left wingback who now has a set of European suitors was a key part of their turnaround, too. </p> \n<p>Tweaking Barreal’s role move repurposed an asset, freeing up more money for the spine.</p> \n<h2>Rule No 4: Look outside roster itself</h2> \n<p>The last ‘golden rule’ of MLS roster construction has very little to do with the roster itself.</p> \n<p>In a league with detailed rules that govern a big chunk of the money you can spend on your roster, it’s crucial to look outside the roster to find competitive advantages. The Columbus Crew did just that ahead of last season, paying CF Montreal a transfer fee to get Wilfried Nancy out of his contract in Canada and down to Ohio. Fast forward a year and Columbus have another MLS Cup and Nancy’s players are<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Chris_Ramirez17/status/1751973349008281851\"> tattooing</a> his quotes on their bodies. </p> \n<p>It’s safe to call that bit of creative thinking a success from Crew president Tim Bezbatchenko.</p> \n<p>Spending money on a coach can help create an edge. The same goes for a premier front office executive – again, FC Cincinnati is a great example. After adding Noonan and Chris Albright as head coach and general manager, respectively, from the Philadelphia Union, they’ve skyrocketed up the Eastern Conference standings over the last two seasons.</p> \n<p>Building a shiny new training facility like the Sounders <a href=\"https://www.soundersfc.com/video/sounders-fc-unveils-new-state-of-the-art-training-center\">just did</a> is a great way to sell prospective signings on your club. If you talk to folks around the game in Europe or in other parts of the world, they’re quick to heap praise on the off-field amenities that many MLS teams provide for their players. </p> \n<p>If you don’t want to have to go out and hunt for quality additions to the first team, why not develop a few of your own? A functional academy system can develop inexpensive MLS starters and generate revenue in the form of transfer fees. FC Dallas has led that charge for years and produced more than a few USMNT players in the process, though a handful of teams across the league are now really starting to push their own youth initiatives forward.</p> \n<p>Even something as small as putting in the time (and a little bit of money) to expedite the green card process for foreign signings can be a difference-maker. Teams only get so many international roster spots in MLS, so quickly re-classifying foreign players as domestic ones creates flexibility to either use or trade international roster spots for other assets within the league.</p> \n<p>While there’s no singular cheat code that will shoot your team to the top, these principles with a mixture of clever imitation and outside-the-box thinking will give you a better chance to get there.</p>"

This is a business that says it has “set new standards of excellence”, affording Trump “the designation of arguably being the preeminent developer of luxury real estate” in the world.

                            "bodyTextSummary": "From Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue to the Trump Building on Wall Street, the Trump World Tower by the United Nations to the Trump International overlooking Central Park, Donald Trump has stamped his name in golden letters on skyscrapers across New York City. This real estate empire was the springboard for Trump’s ascent from tabloid fodder to reality TV stardom, and ultimately the presidency, all built on his self-projected image as America’s most famous businessman.\nWhile the reality of Trump’s business acumen – and the true extent of his wealth – have long been questioned, on Friday a New York judge forever tarnished his gilded image, finding Trump and his allies guilty of frauds that “shock the conscience” and a “lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological”. Trump was ordered to pay $354.9m and was banned from leading a New York business for three years after a court found that he and his associates fraudulently overstated his net worth. The Trump Organization was wrenched from his family’s control – and its future looks far from certain. For decades, the former president has portrayed himself as a brash, bronzed, brilliant businessman who ruled the Manhattan skyline. Whether lecturing Apprentice contestants, charming voters, or bragging to fellow world leaders, he could point to more than a dozen Trump-branded towers as evidence of all he had achieved. Trump is “the archetypal businessman – a dealmaker without peer”, with a name “synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses”, according to his own company: the “very definition of the American success story”.\nBut Judge Arthur Engoron’s ruling is a shocking blow to this image. The same buildings which once embodied the former president’s fame and fortune will, for years, remain supervised by court-appointed monitors. For now, Trump has lost control of the corporation which once provided a stage for his persona. And yet, just as he is separated from his business empire, his political machine is gearing up to propel him back into the Oval Office. Trump has marched closer to the Republican nomination amid – not despite – these legal woes. He has tried to utilize this trial, and the others he faces, to bankroll his comeback campaign. They amount to politicized “witch-hunts”, he tells loyal supporters, suggesting that they, rather than he, are the true targets. Minutes after Trump left the first day of his civil fraud trial in October, his machine sent out a fundraising email. “I just left the courthouse,” it began, claiming that politicians were “weaponizing the legal system to try and completely destroy me” and requesting contributions “of ANY amount – truly, even just $1 – to peacefully DEFEND our movement from the never-ending witch hunts”.\nOver 11 weeks in a Manhattan courtroom, the Trump Organization was publicly exposed to forensic scrutiny for the first time. This is a business that says it has “set new standards of excellence”, affording Trump “the designation of arguably being the preeminent developer of luxury real estate” in the world. Engoron took an altogether different view. Before the trial had even started, he ruled that the former president had committed fraud for years by exaggerating the value of his assets. Now, having heard the evidence, Engoron has imposed an eyewatering financial penalty. How Trump foots this bill is an open question. While his fortune has been pitted at around $2.3bn, the majority of this is tied up in the very business empire at the heart of this case. The money is still coming in. Trump has proven to be a highly effective fundraiser. His campaign raised about $44m in the second half of last year. His legal battles appear to have provided an additional boost.\nBut beyond his race to regain the presidency, Trump is now grappling with legal penalties that could destroy the personal cash pile he has said is at his disposal. Even before Friday’s decision, he had been ordered to pay $83.3m to E Jean Carroll. The former president claimed in a deposition last year to have “substantially in excess” of $400m – a huge sum, but one that would be wiped out by these bills.
